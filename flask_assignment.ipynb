        "## RESTful API & Flask - Detailed Notes\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is a web service that adheres to REST architecture principles. It allows interaction with web services using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning each request from a client to the server must contain all necessary information. The resources are typically represented in formats like JSON or XML.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Explain the concept of API specification\n",
        "An API specification is a document that defines how an API functions, including available endpoints, request and response formats, parameters, authentication methods, and status codes. It serves as a contract between the client and server, ensuring consistent communication. OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) is a popular specification format used to design and document APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that is widely used to build web applications and RESTful APIs. It is popular because of its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use. Flask allows developers to quickly set up web servers and expose endpoints. It also supports extensions like Flask-SQLAlchemy and Flask-RESTful for database and API development.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "Routing in Flask refers to mapping URLs to specific functions in the application. Flask uses the `@app.route()` decorator to bind a URL to a Python function, allowing different parts of the web application to be accessed through various endpoints.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        "To create a simple Flask application:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from flask import Flask\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",
        "@app.route('/')\n",
        "def home():\n",
        "    return \"Hello, World!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
        "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
        "```\n",
        "This script sets up a basic web server that responds with \"Hello, World!\" when the root URL is accessed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        "The common HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs include:\n",
        "- **GET**: Retrieve data from the server\n",
        "- **POST**: Submit new data to the server\n",
        "- **PUT**: Update existing data\n",
        "- **DELETE**: Remove data\n",
        "These methods align with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        "The `@app.route()` decorator in Flask is used to define the route (URL) for a specific function. It tells Flask what URL should trigger the execution of the associated function, effectively connecting web requests to Python code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "- **GET**: Used to retrieve data from the server. Data is sent in the URL, making it visible and limited in length.\n",
        "- **POST**: Used to send data to the server to create or update resources. Data is sent in the body of the request, which is more secure and not visible in the URL.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        "Flask allows custom error handling using error handlers. For example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "@app.errorhandler(404)\n",
        "def not_found(error):\n",
        "    return {\"error\": \"Not found\"}, 404\n",
        "```\n",
        "You can handle different HTTP error codes like 404, 500, etc., and return custom JSON responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n",
        "You can connect Flask to a SQL database using libraries like Flask-SQLAlchemy. Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n",
        "app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///mydb.db'\n",
        "db = SQLAlchemy(app)\n",
        "```\n",
        "This configuration enables Flask to use SQLite as the backend database.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 11. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
        "Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension that integrates SQLAlchemy with Flask. It simplifies database operations like model creation, querying, and migrations. It uses Object Relational Mapping (ORM), allowing developers to interact with the database using Python classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 12. What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n",
        "Flask Blueprints are a way to organize large applications into smaller, manageable components. They allow code related to specific functionalities (e.g., authentication, user management) to be grouped together, improving modularity and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 13. What is the purpose of Flask’s request object?\n",
        "The `request` object in Flask is used to access data sent by the client to the server. This includes form data, query parameters, JSON data, headers, and more. For example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from flask import request\n",
        "name = request.args.get('name')\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 14. How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?\n",
        "```python\n",
        "@app.route('/api/data', methods=['GET'])\n",
        "def get_data():\n",
        "    return jsonify({\"data\": \"Sample\"})\n",
        "```\n",
        "This defines a simple API endpoint that returns JSON data when accessed using the GET method.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 15. What is the purpose of Flask’s jsonify() function?\n",
        "The `jsonify()` function converts Python dictionaries or lists into JSON responses. It also sets the correct MIME type (`application/json`) for the response.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 16. Explain Flask’s url_for() function\n",
        "The `url_for()` function dynamically generates URLs for a given function name. It is useful for avoiding hardcoding URLs and ensures flexibility if routes change. Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "url_for('home')\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 17. How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?\n",
        "Flask serves static files from the `static/` directory by default. You can access a static file like this:\n",
        "```html\n",
        "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}\">\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 18. What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API?\n",
        "An API specification outlines the structure and behavior of an API. It defines endpoints, input parameters, data formats, and response codes. It acts as a blueprint for both the backend and frontend teams, ensuring consistent communication and smooth integration.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n",
        "HTTP status codes indicate the result of a client’s request. Examples:\n",
        "- 200: OK\n",
        "- 201: Created\n",
        "- 400: Bad Request\n",
        "- 404: Not Found\n",
        "- 500: Server Error\n",
        "Returning appropriate status codes helps clients understand the outcome of their requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 20. How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n",
        "You can handle POST requests like this:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])\n",
        "def submit():\n",
        "    data = request.get_json()\n",
        "    return jsonify(data), 201\n",
        "```\n",
        "This reads JSON data from the request and returns it with a status code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 21. How would you secure a Flask API?\n",
        "Security measures include:\n",
        "- Input validation and sanitization\n",
        "- Using HTTPS\n",
        "- Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT)\n",
        "- Rate limiting\n",
        "- CORS management\n",
        "- Secure session handling\n",
        "\n",
        "### 22. What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension?\n",
        "Flask-RESTful is an extension that simplifies the creation of REST APIs with Flask. It adds support for class-based views and automatic request parsing. It makes API development more structured and reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 23. What is the role of Flask’s session object?\n",
        "The `session` object in Flask allows you to store information specific to a user across requests. It uses cookies and is often used to manage login sessions or temporary user data.\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from flask import session\n",
        "session['username'] = 'Kamran'\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
